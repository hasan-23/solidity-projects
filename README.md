# 🛡️ Solidity Projects – Built by Hasan [@md_tanvir4](https://x.com/md_tanvir4)

This repository showcases Solidity smart contracts developed as part of my Solidity Roadmap.  
Each project focuses on secure development practices, freelance-readiness, and auditability — preparing for real-world Web3 environments.
